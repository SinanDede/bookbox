Carlotta R. Anderson,Hardcover,"""All-American Anarchist"" chronicles the life and work of Joseph A. Labadie (1850-1933), Detroit's prominent labor organizer and one of early labor's most influential activists. A dynamic participant in the major social reform movements of the Gilded Age, Labadie was a central figure in the pervasive struggle for a new social order as the American Midwest underwent rapid industrialization at the end of the 19th century. This engaging biography follows Labadie's colorful career from a childhood among a Pottawatomi tribe in the Michigan woods through his local and national involvement in a maze of late 19th-century labor and reform activities, including participation in the Socialist Labor party, Knights of Labor, Greenback movement, trades councils, typographical union, eight-hour-day campaigns, and the rise of the American Federation of Labor. In writing this biography of her grandfather, Carlotta R. Anderson consulted the renowned Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan, a unique collection of protest literature which extensively documents pivotal times in American labor history and radical history.","Labor,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356461214l/1001079.jpg,814327079,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001079.All_American_Anarchist,324,3.83,1,All-American Anarchist: Joseph A.

Jeffrey Pfeffer,Hardcover,"Why is common sense so uncommon when it comes to managing people? How is it that so many seemingly intelligent organizations implement harmful management practices and ideas? In his provocative new book, ,The Human Equation,, bestselling author Jeffrey Pfeffer examines why much of the current conventional wisdom is wrong and asks us to re-think the way managers link people with organizational performance. Pfeffer masterfully builds a powerful business case for managing people effectivelyâ€”not just because it makes for good corporate policy, but because it results in outstanding performance and profits. Challenging current thinking and practice, Pfeffer: reveals the costs of downsizing and provides alternatives; identifies troubling trends in compensation, and suggests better practices; explains why even the smartest managers sometimes manage people unwisely; demonstrates how market-based forces can fail to create good people management practices, creating a need for positive public policy; and provides practical guidelines for implementing high-performance management practices. Filled with information and ideas, ,The Human Equation, provides much-needed guidance for managing people more wisely and more profitably.","Business,Leadership,Romance,Historical Romance,Nonfiction,Business,Management,Management,Human Resources",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400939083l/1001090.jpg,875848419,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001090.The_Human_Equation,368,3.73,7,The Human Equation: Building Profits by Putting People First,119
Jeffrey Pfeffer,Paperback,"""Competitive Advantage Through People"" explores why - despite long-standing evidence that a committed work force is essential for success - firms continue to attach little importance to their workers. The answer, argues Pfeffer, resides in a complex web of factors based on perception, history, legislation, and practice that continues to dominate management thought and action. Yet, some organizations have been able to overcome these obstacles. In fact, the five common stocks with the highest returns between 1972 and 1992 - Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, Circuit City, and Plenum Publishing - were in industries that shared virtually none of the characteristics traditionally associated with strategic success. What each of these firms did share is the ability to produce sustainable competitive advantage through its way of managing people. Pfeffer documents how they - and others - resisted traditional management pitfalls, and offers frameworks for implementing these changes in any industry.","Business,Leadership,Business,Management,Romance,Historical Romance",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387741596l/1001092.jpg,087584717X,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001092.Competitive_Advantage_Through_People,304,3.65,1,Competitive Advantage Through People: Unleashing the Power of the Work Force,20

Nick Le Neve Walmsley,Paperback,"At the time of her construction in the late 1920s, His Majesty's Airship R101 was the largest flying object ever madeâ€”as big and luxurious as an ocean liner, a Titanic of the skies designed to link the far-flung corners of the British Empire within days.Â As Britain recovered from the horrors of the trenches, R101's graceful lines, vast size, and luxurious accommodation came to represent the supreme self-confidence and hopes of a nation. But that unclouded vision was fatally colored by personal ambition, heroism, weakness, and political intrigue that touched many lives and reached a terrible climax on a storm-lashed hillside in France in the early hours of October 5,Â 1930.Â This book is the first to tell her story through contemporary photographs and actual material used during her construction. By returning to original sources, Nick Walmsley challenges the long-held view that R101 was a bad aircraft built by careless people. Atmospherically capturing the heady days of the 1920s, ,R101: A Pictorial History, has wide appeal to aviation enthusiasts, social historians, and anyone fascinated by a tale of an heroic dream with a horrific end.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328818548l/10011431.jpg,752456830,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10011431-r101,160,5,2,R101: A Pictorial History,3

Mark Verman,Paperback,"The earliest medieval Jewish mystical writings, or kabbalah, date from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. This is the first book to focus on the most prodigious group active at that time--the 'Circle of Contemplation'.,The 'Circle of Contemplation' generated a mystical theology that differs radically from mainstream kabbalistic theosophy. Two of this group's penetrating speculations on God and the origins of the universe are The Book of Contemplation and The Fountain of Wisdom. A meticulous and systematic study of these writings forms the core of this book.,Verman discovered that the 'Circle of Contemplation' produced a series of distinct treatises, each entitled The Book of Contemplation and attributed to the same fictitious author. These treatises, embodying one of the most intriguing puzzles of medieval literature, are included here.,The author concludes that these writings were a product of thirteenth-century Spain, not France, as claimed by Gershom Scholem. His conclusion engendered a critical evaluation of the premises of Scholem's historiography of early medieval Jewish mysticism.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1527071079l/10011932.jpg,791407209,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10011932-the-books-of-contemplation,282,4.75,1,The Books of Contemplation: Medieval Jewish Mystical Sources,4

In doing so he also unravels the many theoretical strategies in the study of religion that have been developed and explored by later anthropologists. Besides discussing the classical authors and the debates surrounding their work, Morris presents perceptive accounts of more contemporary scholars such as Jung, Malinowski, Levi-Strauss, Geertz, and Godelier.

Richard Layard,Paperback,"There is a paradox at the heart of our lives. We all want more money, but as societies become richer, they do not become happier. This is not speculation: It's the story told by countless pieces of scientific research. We now have sophisticated ways of measuring how happy people are, and all the evidence shows that on average people have grown no happier in the last fifty years, even as average incomes have more than doubled.The central question the great economist Richard Layard asks in ,Happiness, is this: If we really wanted to be happier, what would we do differently? First we'd have to see clearly what conditions generate happiness and then bend all our efforts toward producing them. That is what this book is about-the causes of happiness and the means we have to effect it.,Until recently there was too little evidence to give a good answer to this essential question, but, Layard shows us, thanks to the integrated insights of psychology, sociology, applied economics, and other fields, we can now reach some firm conclusions, conclusions that will surprise you. ,Happiness, is an illuminating road map, grounded in hard research, to a better, happier life for us all.","Psychology,Nonfiction,Economics,Science,Philosophy,Self Help,Self Help,Personal Development,Sociology,Writing,Journalism,Politics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309287208l/100120.jpg,143037013,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100120.Happiness,320,3.73,85,Happiness: Lessons from a New Science,924

Philip Mansel,Hardcover,"Throughout history rulers have used clothes as a form of legitimization and propaganda. While palaces, pictures, and jewels might reflect the choice of a monarchâ€™s predecessors or advisers, clothes reflected the preferences of the monarch himself. Being both personal and visible, the right costume at the right time could transform and define a monarchâ€™s reputation. Many royal leaders have known this, from Louis XIV to Catherine the Great and from Napoleon I to Princess Diana.,This intriguing book explores how rulers have sought to control their image through their appearance. Mansel shows how individual styles of dress throw light on the personalities of particular monarchs, on their court system, and on their ambitions. The book looks also at the economics of the costume industry, at patronage, at the etiquette involved in mourning dress, and at the act of dressing itself. Fascinating glimpses into the lives of European monarchs and contemporary potentates reveal the intimate connection between power and the way it is packaged.","History,Couture,Fashion,Nonfiction,Historical,Cultural,France",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328871490l/1001221.jpg,300106971,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001221.Dressed_to_Rule,256,3.58,5,Dressed to Rule: Royal and Court Costume from Louis XIV to Elizabeth II,24
Umberto Eco,Hardcover,"In the course of the long debate on the nature and the classification of signs, from Boethius to Ockham, there are at least three lines of thought: the Stoic heritage, that influences Augustine, Abelard, Francis Bacon; the Aristotelian tradition, stemming from the commentaries on ,De Interpretatione;, the discussion of the grammarians, from Priscian to the Modistae. Modern interpreters are frequently misled by the fact that the various authors regularly used the same terms. Such a homogeneous terminology, however, covers profound theoretical differences. The aim of these essays is to show that the medieval theory of signs does not represent a unique body of semiotic notions: there are diverse and frequently alternative semiotic theories. This book thus represents an attempt to encourage further research on the still unrecognized variety of the semiotic approaches offered by the medieval philosophies of language.",History,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362957934l/1001231.jpg,9027232938,9.79E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001231.On_The_Medieval_Theory_Of_Signs,0,4.1,0,On The Medieval Theory Of Signs,10

"Christopher Peterson,Martin E.P. Seligman",Hardcover,"Character has become a front-and-center topic in contemporary discourse, but this term does not have a fixed meaning. Character may be simply defined by what someone does not do, but a more active and thorough definition is necessary, one that addresses certain vital questions. Is character a singular characteristic of an individual, or is it composed of different aspects? Does character--however we define it--exist in degrees, or is it simply something one happens to have? How can character be developed? Can it be learned? Relatedly, can it be taught, and who might be the most effective teacher? What roles are played by family, schools, the media, religion, and the larger culture? This groundbreaking handbook of character strengths and virtues is the first progress report from a prestigious group of researchers who have undertaken the systematic classification and measurement of widely valued positive traits. They approach good character in terms of separate strengths-authenticity, persistence, kindness, gratitude, hope, humor, and so on-each of which exists in degrees.,Character Strengths and Virtues, classifies twenty-four specific strengths under six broad virtues that consistently emerge across history and culture: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Each strength is thoroughly examined in its own chapter, with special attention to its meaning, explanation, measurement, causes, correlates, consequences, and development across the life span, as well as to strategies for its deliberate cultivation.

"Fernando Henrique Cardoso,Brian Winter",Paperback,"Fernando Henrique Cardoso received a phone call in the middle of the night asking him to be the new Finance Minister of Brazil. As he put the phone down and stared into the darkness of his hotel room, he feared he'd been handed a political death sentence. The year was 1993, and he would be responsible for an economy that had had seven different currencies in the previous eight years to cope with inflation that had run at 3000 percent a year. Brazil had a habit of chewing up finance ministers with the ferocity of an Amazon piranha. This was just one of the turns in a largely unscripted and sometimes unwanted political career. In exile during the harshest period of the junta that ruled Brazil for twenty years, Cardoso started his political life with a tentative run for the Federal Senate in 1978. Within fifteen years, and despite himself, this former sociologist was running the country.,And what a country! Brazil, it is often said, is on the edge of modernity, striding with one foot in mid-air towards the future, the other still rooted deep in a traditional past. It is a land of sophisticated music and brutal gold-digging, of the next global superpower and the last old-time coffee plantations. It is gloriously ungovernable, irrepressibly attractive, and home to the family, friends and extraordinary life of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. This is his story and his love song to his country.","History,Cultural,Brazil,Nonfiction,Biography,Politics,Autobiography,Memoir,Economics,Culture,Society",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437014640l/1001322._SY475_.jpg,1586483242,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001322.The_Accidental_President_of_Brazil,291,4.14,42,The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir,416
Gustavo Gorriti,Paperback,"First published in Peru in 1990, ,The Shining Path, was immediately hailed as one of the finest works on the insurgency that plagued that nation for over fifteen years. A richly detailed and absorbing account, it covers the dramatic years between the guerrillas' opening attack in 1980 and President Fernando Belaunde's reluctant decision to send in the military to contain the growing rebellion in late 1982. Covering the strategy, actions, successes, and setbacks of both the government and the rebels, the book shows how the tightly organized insurgency forced itself upon an unwilling society just after the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime.,One of Peru's most distinguished journalists, Gustavo Gorriti first covered the Shining Path movement for the leading Peruvian newsweekly, ,Caretas,.

Shiller,Paperback,"As Robert Shillerâ€™s new 2009 preface to his prescient classic on behavioral economics and market volatility asserts, the irrational exuberance of the stock and housing markets â€œhas been ended by an economic crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.â€ As we all, ordinary Americans and professional investors alike, crawl from the wreckage of our heedless bubble economy, the shrewd insights and sober warnings, and hard facts that Shiller marshals in this book are more invaluable than ever. ,The original and bestselling 2000 edition of Irrational Exuberance evoked Alan Greenspanâ€™s infamous 1996 use of that phrase to explain the alternately soaring and declining stock market. It predicted the collapse of the tech stock bubble through an analysis of the structural, cultural, and psychological factors behind levels of price growth not reflected in any other sector of the economy. In the second edition (2005), Shiller folded real estate into his analysis of market volatility, marshalling evidence that housing prices were dangerously inflated as well, a bubble that could soon burst, leading to a â€œstring of bankruptciesâ€ and a â€œworldwide recession.â€ That indeed came to pass, with consequences that the 2009 preface to this edition deals with. ,Irrational Exuberance is more than ever a cogent, chilling, and astonishingly far-seeing analytical work that no one with any money in any market anywhere can afford not to readâ€“and heed.","Economics,Economics,Finance,Business,Nonfiction,Psychology,Currency,Money,History,Finance,Personal Finance,Science,Philosophy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384376065l/100132.jpg,767923634,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100132.Irrational_Exuberance,304,3.98,275,Irrational Exuberance,7019
Marilyn Butler,Paperback,"It is often said that Jane Austen in the countryside remained isolated from the great events of her time. But as Marilyn Butler points out in ,Jane Austen and the War of Ideas,, Austen was not isolated from reading novels, and novels carried controversy. The sentimental novel of the previous generation, the Jacobin novel of William Godwin, the philosophical comedy of Robert Bage and Maria Edgeworth--all conveyed their own kind of ideological meaning. By recognizing Austen's relationship to the literature of ideas, Butler offers acute readings of each of the novels and an intellectual context in which to see them as a whole.","Criticism,Literary Criticism,Nonfiction,Criticism,Language,Writing,Literature,History,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420787916l/1001337.jpg,198129688,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001337.Jane_Austen_and_the_War_of_Ideas,356,3.96,6,Jane Austen and the War of Ideas,52

"Leo Bagrow,Raleigh Ashlin Skelton",Hardcover,"This illustrated work is intended to acquaint readers with the early maps produced in both Europe and the rest of the world, and to tell us something of their development, their makers and printers, their varieties and characteristics. The authors' chief concern is with the appearance of maps: they exclude any examination of their content, or of scientific methods of mapmaking. This book ends in the second half of the eighteenth century, when craftsmanship was superseded by specialized science and the machine. As a history of the evolution of the early map, it is a stunning work of art and science.,This expanded second edition of Bagrow and Skelton's ,History of Cartography, marks the reappearance of this seminal work after a hiatus of nearly a half century. As a reprint project undertaken many years after the book last appeared, finding suitable materials to work from proved to be no easy task. Because of the wealth of monochrome and color plates, the book could only be properly reproduced using the original materials. Ultimately the authors were able to obtain materials from the original printer Scotchprints or contact films made directly from original plates, thus allowing the work to preserve the beauty and clarity of the illustrations.,Old maps, collated with other materials, help us to elucidate the course of human history. It was not until the eighteenth century, however, that maps were gradually stripped of their artistic decoration and transformed into plain, specialist sources of information based upon measurement. Maps are objects of historical, artistic, and cultural significance, and thus collecting them seems to need no justification, simply enjoyment.",,,913750336,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10013570-history-of-cartography,312,5,0,History of Cartography: Enlarged Second Edition,1
B. Mark Smith,Paperback,"The stock market is big news today. Over 50 percent of the American public own stocks directly or indirectly, meaning that the financial well-being of tens of millions of people is directly tied to the market. Alan Greenspan has stated that it is not possible to understand the modern economy without understanding the stock market. But this has not always been so. ,Many people now alive can remember a very different time, when the stock market was little more than a primitive insiders' game, viewed by most Americans with skepticism and suspicion. In ,Toward Rational Exuberance,, B. Mark Smith, a professional stock trader with two decades of practical experience, tells the story of how this stunning transformation occurred. It is a fascinating story, involving colorful personalities, dramatic events, and revolutionary new ideas. In the course of the narrative, Smith traces the evolution of popular theories of stock market behavior, showing how they have greatly influenced the way the investing public views the market. But he also shows how some of these theories are based on faulty interpretations of market history that may lead investors astray. Freshly updated, this is a timely -- and definitive -- account of the market's true history and dangerous myths.","Economics,Finance,Economics,History,Finance,Personal Finance,Nonfiction,Currency,Money,Business,Menage,M M M",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311994684l/100135.jpg,374528500,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100135.Toward_Rational_Exuberance,352,3.73,3,Toward Rational Exuberance: The Evolution of the Modern Stock Market,44

"Carly Mine,Carly Mine",Paperback,"When adult entertainment first appeared on the pop culture radar as an underground film phenomenon, women were little more than starlets, whoâ€”for the most partâ€”answered to men. But as pornography evolved in step with technology and consumer demand over the past twenty years, it also reflected the shifting political climate. Greater sexual equality started to appear both in front of and behind the cameras. Not only did female performers take charge for the first time of their careers, but women began running the companies people purchase movies from, opening woman-friendly sex shops and writing thoughtful, analytical commentary on pornography-often from a feminist perspective.,In ,Naked Ambition,, adult entertainment industry insider Carly Milne takes readers behind the scenes and on to the frontlines of today's woman-owned and supported adult entertainment industry that has revolutionized both pornography and the traditional feminist movement that has for years often stood in opposition to it. Personal essays by Jenna Jameson, Theresa Flynt, Violet Blue, Holly Randall, Tristan Taormino, Tera Patrick, Danni Ashe, Nina Hartley, Jane Duvall and Rachel Kramer Bussel, among other top women pornographers and pornography supporters showcase this relatively recent but fast-growing segment of adult entertainment producers and consumers.","Nonfiction,Sociology,Sexuality,Sex Work,Feminism,Sexuality,Gender,GLBT,Queer",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348423970l/1001379.jpg,786715901,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001379.Naked_Ambition,340,3.54,2,Naked Ambition: Women Who Are Changing Pornography,46
Martin Evans,Hardcover,"Invaded in 1830, populated by one million settlers who co-existed uneasily with nine million Arabs and Berbers, Algeria was different from other French colonies because it was administered as an integral part of France, in theory no different from Normandy or Brittany. The depth and scale of the colonization process explains why the Algerian War of 1954 to 1962 was one of the longest and most violent of the decolonization struggles.,An undeclared war in the sense that there was no formal beginning of hostilities, the war produced huge tensions that brought down four governments, ended the Fourth Republic in 1958, and mired the French army in accusations of torture and mass human rights abuses. In carefully re-examining the origins and consequences of the conflict, Martin Evans argues that it was the Socialist led Republican Front, in power from January 1956 until May 1957, which was the defining moment in the war. Predicated on the belief in the universal civilizing mission of the Fourth Republic, coupled with the conviction that Algerian nationalism was feudal and religiously fanatical in character, the Republican Front dramatically intensified the war in the spring of 1956.,Drawing upon previously classified archival sources as well as new oral testimonies, this book underlines the conflict of values between the Republican Front and Algerian nationalism, explaining how this clash produced patterns of thought and action, such as the institutionalization of torture and the raising of pro-French Muslim militias, which tragically polarized choices and framed all subsequent stages of the conflict.","History,Cultural,Africa,Northern Africa,Algeria,Cultural,France,Nonfiction,Religion,Islam,Military,Military History,Africa,Northern Africa",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348010302l/10013840.jpg,192803506,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10013840-algeria,457,4.3,6,Algeria: France's Undeclared War,90
Jerome Murphy-O'Connor,Paperback,"For someone who has exercised such a profound influence on Christian theology, Paul remains a shadowy figure behind the barrier of his complicated and difficult biblical letters. Debates about his meaning have deflected attention from his personality, yet his personality is an important key to understanding his theological ideas. This book redresses the balance. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's disciplined imagination, nourished by a lifetime of research, shapes numerous textual, historical, and archaeological details into a colourful and enjoyable story of which Paul is the flawed but undefeated hero., This chronological narrative offers new insights into Paul's intellectual, emotional, and religious development and puts his travels, mission, and theological ideas into a plausible biographical context. As he changes from an assimilated Jewish teenager in Tarsus to a competitive Pharisee in Jerusalem and then to a driven missionary of Christ, the sometimes contradictory components of Paul's complex personality emerge from the way he interacts with people and problems. His theology was forged in dialogue and becomes more intelligible as our appreciation of his person deepens. In Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's engaging biography, the Apostle comes to life as a complex, intensely human individual.","Religion,Religion,Theology,Christianity,New Testament",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348064280l/1001384.jpg,199283842,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001384.Paul,259,3.73,9,Paul: His Story,56
Sumpter Priddy,Hardcover,"Between 1790 and 1840, millions of middle-class Americans throughout the nation encountered ""Fancy"": they rode in a Fancy sleigh, dressed up in Fancy clothes, blew their noses in Fancy handkerchiefs, bought goods at Fancy shops, ate at Fancy tables on Fancy dishes, and slept under Fancy coverlets. Not just fancy but Fancy: an early nineteenth-century cultural phenomenon born out of new and enlightened ways of seeing, understanding, and responding to the surrounding world. Fancy expressed itself in just about everything that pleased the senses; generally colorful and boldly patterned, it elicited delight, awe, surprise, whim, and caprice. Whether experienced in the form of painted surfaces, kaleidoscopic quilts, or imaginary landscapes, Fancy engaged the emotions and expanded the imagination, expressing the core of human fancy. ""American Fancy"" offers an appropriately fantastic experience of this uniquely American sensibility. Author Sumpter Priddy has assembled and produced an original oeuvre in the field of decorative arts, going beyond the traditional modes of furniture analysis, which concentrate on style, history, and construction, to consider the perceptual and emotional responses through which the original users and viewers would have interacted with these material things. To this end he employs the interpretive methods used in the fields of literature, fine arts, philosophy and even psychology. Rich, fully illustrated, wondrously researched, and bound in a cover that imitates a typical Fancy pattern, ""American Fancy"" does its marvelous subject true.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348341234l/100139.jpg,972435395,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100139.American_Fancy,267,4.13,0,American Fancy: Exuberance in the Arts 1790-1840,8

Janice G. Raymond,Paperback,"Fifteen years ago, when it was first published, ""The Transsexual Empire"" challenged the medical psychiatric definition of transsexualism as a disease and sex conversion hormones and surgery as the cure. It exposed the antifeminist stereotyping that requires candidates for transsexual surgery to prove themselves by conforming to subjective, outdated and questionable feminine roles and ""passing"" as women. Then as now, defining and treating transsexualism as a medical problem prevents the person experiencing so-called gender dissatisfaction from seeing it in a gender-challenging or feminist framework. Transsexualism goes to the question of what gender is, how to challenge it, and what reinforces gender stereotyping in a role-defined society. In the new introduction to this feminist work, Raymond discusses how these same issues are now debated in the context of transgender. Transgenderism reduces gender resistance to wardrobes, hormones, surgery and posturing - anything but real sexual equality. It assimilates the roles and definitions of masculinity and femininity, often mixing and matching, but never really moving beyond both.,In a similar way, transsexualism is thought to be a radical challenge to gender roles, breaking the boundaries of gender and transgressing its rigid lines. But if the transsexual merely exchanges one gender role for another, and if the outcome of such a sex reassignment is to endorse a femininity which, in many transsexuals, becomes a caricature of much that feminists have rejected about many-made femininity, then where is the challenge, the transgression, and the breaking of any real boundaries? This book will be used as a text in women's studies, psychology, sociology, technology and public policy, as well as by medical students, law students, and all who have an interest in feminist issues.","Feminism,Nonfiction,Gender,GLBT,Queer,LGBT,LGBT,Transgender,Psychology,Philosophy,Politics,Social",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346281085l/1001441.jpg,807762725,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001441.The_Transsexual_Empire,264,2.83,47,The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male,198

Richard L. Kagan,Hardcover,"This engrossing book examines the particular importance of cities in Spanish and Hispanic-American culture as well as the different meanings that artists and cartographers invested in their depiction of New and Old World cities and towns. Kagan maintains that cities are both built structures and human communities, and that representations of the urban form reflect both points of view. He discusses the peculiar character of Spain's ""empire of towns""; the history and development of the cityscape as an independent artistic genre, both in Europe and in the Americas; the interaction between European and native mapping traditions; differences between European maps of urban America and those produced by local residents, whether native or creole; and the urban iconography of four different New World towns.

Richard L. Kagan,Hardcover,"Setting aside the pastiche of bullfighters and flamenco dancers that has dominated the U.S. image of Spain for more than a century, this innovative volume uncovers the roots of Spanish studies to explain why the diversity, vitality, and complexity of Spanish history and culture have been reduced in U.S. accounts to the equivalent of a tourist brochure., Â , Spurred by the complex colonial relations between the United States and Spain, the new field of Spanish studies offered a way for the young country to reflect a positive image of itself as a democracy, in contrast with perceived Spanish intolerance and closure. Spain in America investigates the political and historical forces behind this duality, surveying the work of the major nineteenth-century U.S. Hispanists in the fields of history, art history, literature, and music., A distinguished panel of contributors offers fresh examinations of the role of U.S. writers, especially Washington Irving and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, in crafting a wildly romantic vision of Spain., Â They examine the views of such scholars as William H.

Black and White America are locked in the tense grip of massive change. Into this inferno steps an unsuspecting young White couple. Neither had truly known even a single African American person while growing up. Now, a child will change all of that forever. In this fateful moment, a Black baby becomes perhaps the first in the history of New Mexico to be adopted by a White family. Here is a brazenly honest glimpse into the mind and heart of that child, a true story for the ages that flows like a soulful river-separated from his mother at birth, placed into foster care, adopted, and finally reunited with his biological family in adulthood-an astounding journey of personal discovery. Jaiya John has opened the floodgates on his own childhood with this piercing memoir. Black Baby White Hands, a waterfall of jazz splashing over the rocks of love, pain and the honoring of family.

But how far does the later work of archaeologists in Crete support this view?,Drawing on his experience of being actively involved in research on landscapes processes and prehistory for the last twenty years, Castleden writes clearly and accessibly to provide a text essential to the study of this fascinating subject.,""","History,Nonfiction,History,Archaeology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348827100l/1001745.jpg,041508833X,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001745.Minoans,236,3.93,10,Minoans: Life in Bronze Age Crete,97

The team that had limped along since the golden era of Magic Johnson was now endowed with basketball's two most gifted and dominant players, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, and was led by none other than Phil Jackson, the most fabled coach in the NBA. By the time the Lakers beat Indiana in game six of the championship series, they showed themselves unstoppable, a team above and apart and blessed with a glamour and facility that made them the obvious franchise to lead pro basketball into the new millennium.. .,Then everything began to fall apart. Jackson had warned his team that the truly challenging season is the one ""after ""an initial big win, and his words were quickly becoming reality as the great team slipped into profound disarray at the start of the new season. ""Ain't No Tomorrow ""is an intimate look at the astonishing eight-month roller-coaster ride that became the Lakers' 2000-2001 season: a time of tumult and drama when impulses toward brotherhood and unity dissolved into petty, uglybattles and bruised egos; when men who previously rose to a great challenge grew greedy and slack.. .,Combining brilliant reporting and original perspective, Elizabeth Kaye--a journalist granted special access to Jackson, Shaq, Kobe, and other major players--takes you into the minds and hearts of the team members.

RoxAnn Klugman,Hardcover,"In 1944 Anne Scheiber, a lifelong federal employee whose income never surpassed $3,150 a year -- yes, the figure is correct! -- invested $5,000 in blue-chip stocks. When she died in 1995 her stocks were worth $22 million -- that figure is also correct! -- and she was receiving an annual income of over $1 million in dividends from them. The Dividend Growth Investment Strategy tells how she did it and how others can invest long-term in stock for retirement income.Over half of all Americans have money in the stock market, most of it in mutual funds. But most mutual funds underperform the stock market, and they are taxed. The taxes and fees destroy compounding of investments and diminish the retirement nest egg. Anne Scheiber's method, the Dividend Growth Investment Strategy (DGIS), beats the mutual fund in returns fivefold after thirty years, though both approaches achieve 14 percent annual growth.,This book examines and compares the various investment strategies of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds and shows in hard figures why DGIS is the better investment strategy. The DGIS maximizes growth of the nest egg while producing income that doubles every five years. It also minimizes anxiety over market downturns and inflation because investors can ride the market ""roller coaster"" by keeping their capital growing, while riding the stock market ""escalator"" through dividend growth returns, all the while avoiding taxes on their dividends.,To help the investor choose stocks, company fundamentals are discussed along with suggestions on how to research them and what materials to use.","Economics,Finance,Finance,Personal Finance",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347623881l/1001916.jpg,806521821,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001916.The_Dividend_Growth_Investment_Strategy,290,4,1,The Dividend Growth Investment Strategy: How to Keep Your Retirement Income Doubling Every Five Years,13

Eithne Quinn,Paperback,"In the late 1980s, gangsta rap music emerged in urban America, giving voice to--and making money for--a social group widely considered to be in crisis: young, poor, black men. From its local origins, gangsta rap went on to flood the mainstream, generating enormous popularity and profits. Yet the highly charged lyrics, public battles, and hard, fast lifestyles that characterize the genre have incited the anger of many public figures and proponents of ""family values."" Constantly engaging questions of black identity and race relations, poverty and wealth, gangsta rap represents one of the most profound influences on pop culture in the last thirty years.,Focusing on the artists Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, the Geto Boys, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur, Quinn explores the origins, development, and immense appeal of gangsta rap. Including detailed readings in urban geography, neoconservative politics, subcultural formations, black cultural debates, and music industry conditions, this book explains how and why this music genre emerged. In ,Nuthin'but a ""G"" Thang,, Quinn argues that gangsta rap both reflected and reinforced the decline in black protest culture and the great rise in individualist and entrepreneurial thinking that took place in the U.S. after the 1970s. Uncovering gangsta rap's deep roots in black working-class expressive culture, she stresses the music's aesthetic pleasures and complexities that have often been ignored in critical accounts.","Music,Music,Hip Hop",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348110069l/1001929.jpg,231124090,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001929.Nuthin_But_a_G_Thang,251,3.59,5,"Nuthin' But a ""G"" Thang: The Culture and Commerce of Gangsta Rap",39

Readers will learn about the great team that Connie Mack built in Philadelphia and about the famed outfield duo of Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford in Detroit.

Mantak Chia,Paperback,"A guide to nourishing the body through bone marrow rejuvenation exercises ,â€¢ Presents exercises to â€œregrowâ€ bone marrow, revive the internal organs, and prevent osteoporosis ,â€¢ Explains the use of bone breathing and bone compression, â€œhittingâ€ to detoxify the body, and sexual energy massage and chi weight lifting to enhance the life force within ,Most Westerners believe that a daily physical exercise program helps slow the aging process. Yet those whose bodies appear most physically fit on the outside often enjoy only the same life span as the average nonathletic person. It is the internal organs and glands that nourish every function of the body, and it is the bone marrow that nourishes and rejuvenates the organs and glands through the production of blood. By focusing only on the muscles without cultivating the internal organs, bones, and blood, the Western fitness regimen can ultimately exhaust the internal system. ,In ,Bone Marrow Nei Kung, Master Mantak Chia reveals the ancient mental and physical Taoist techniques used to â€œregrowâ€ bone marrow, strengthen the bones, and rejuvenate the organs and glands. An advanced practice of Iron Shirt Chi Kung, Bone Marrow Nei Kung was developed as a way to attain the â€œsteel bodyâ€ coveted in the fields of Chinese medicine and martial arts. This method of absorbing energy into the bones revives the bone marrow and reverses the effects of aging through the techniques of bone breathing, bone compression, and sexual energy massage, which stimulates the hormonal production that helps prevent osteoporosis. Also included is extensive information on chi weight lifting and the practice of â€œhittingâ€ to detoxify the body.","Combat,Martial Arts,Religion,Taoism,Spirituality",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391972906l/100206.jpg,159477112X,9.78E+12,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100206.Bone_Marrow_Nei_Kung,272,4.09,2,Bone Marrow Nei Kung: Taoist Techniques for Rejuvenating the Blood and Bone,77
